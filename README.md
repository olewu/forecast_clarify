Local water temperature (3m) weekly forecasts based on local statistics (seasonal cycle, week-to-week persistence) from NorKyst800 (2006 - 2022).

Forecasts can be created for all [BarentsWatch Sites](https://www.barentswatch.no/). Model parameters at these sights are derived from the closest grid points in the high-resolution ocean model ROMS, run in the NorKyst800 set-up (described in [Asplin et al., 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10236-020-01378-0)).
